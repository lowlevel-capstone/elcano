pick 247e5cb The loop timing code is buggy. It uses an unsigned variable for a signed quantity that is almost certainly negative. Observed symptom was that the loop went through one pass then hung. That is consistent with a very very very large delay time, when the negative number is interpreted as a very very very large positive number. Two takeaways: First, do not use unsigned unless you are entirely certain you have positive quantities.  Presence of a subtraction should be a warning flag. Walk through code paths with all cases. Second, test your work before pushing it into the main repository. Due to time constraints, I am putting back the last working loop code, which is the rollover protection code. We can have a debate about whether this should be kept at some later date. Right now, we need to have the loop working. Also, it appears the include of ElcanoSerial.h was removed at some point. That is necessary -- the file won't even compile without it -- so I've put it back.

pick b799571 resynch other files with master branch.
pick 46f4fdf Adding support for Spektrum ESTOP signal; the Spektrum receiver is not currently working so this has not yet been tested live.
pick c075b48 removing extra nested RC folder
pick 30abac3 This change adds the number field to a drive packet, otherwise this is ommitted from the packet even if the field is set.
pick 31c1cc3 C2-LL changes: - Added a "DEBUG" variable and put most serial monitor output statements in a debugging conditional. - changed include statements; elcanoserial.h and settings.h are not default directory header files and need quotes RC changes: need init on ESerial UART, changed how analog throttle and turn values are handled to make sure throttle and turn are always in the range of 0-255 when passed to C2
pick 381f8a8 Added a debugging conditional. Added debugging messages in place of unconditional serial printouts. Integrated functions to convert RC values to LL values
pick 2340815 changed quotes to angle brackets in C2 includes
pick 3ab2c1e Do floating point division in conversion from byte turn values to servo us.
